KotlinTest
----------
This is a simple Android example app using [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) Language.

App shows a `RecyclerView` with 100 items, when each item is clicked, a toast with item content will show. You can download the apk [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/westlinkin/KotlinTest/master/app-debug.apk).

As you can see, after using `Kotlin` language, the code manages to be reduced ~30%. 

Hope this helps. Enjoy.
